        "\n",
        "Both NumPy and PyTorch have the same rules for broadcasting. When two tensors are involved in an elementwise operation, NumPy/PyTorch tries to broadcast them (i.e. copying them along dimensions) so that they both have the same shape. The rules of broadcasting are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You can prepend dummy dimensions (of size 1) to the start of a tensor until both have the same number of dimensions\n",
        "2. After this point, if some dimension has size 1 in one of the tensors, it can be repeated until it matches the size of the corresponding dimension in the other tensor\n",
        "\n",
        "To give a simple example - suppose we have a 2D batch of data, of shape `data.shape = (N, k)` (i.e. we have `N` separate datapoints, each being a vector of length `k`). Suppose we want to add a vector `vec` of length `k` to each datapoint. This is a valid operation, because when we try and add these two objects together:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `vec` gets prepended with a dummy dimension so it has shape `(1, k)` and both are 2D\n",
        "2. `vec` gets repeated along the first dimension so it has shape `(N, k)`, matching the shape of `data`\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, our output has shape `(N, k)`, and elements `output[i, j] = data[i, j] + vec[j]`.\n",

        "Broadcasting can be a very easy place to make mistakes, because it's easy to lose track of the exact shape of your tensors involved. As a warm-up exercise, below are some examples of broadcasting. Can you figure out which are valid, and which will raise errors?\n",

        "2. Omitting a letter means that the axis will be summed over.\n",
        "    * For example, if `x` is a 2D array with shape `(I, J)`, then `einops.einsum(x, \"i j -> i\")` will be a 1D array of length `I` containing the row sums of `x` (we're summing along the `j`-index, i.e. across rows).\n",
        "3. We can return the unsummed axes in any order.\n",
        "    * For example, `einops.einsum(x, \"i j k -> k j i\")` does the same thing as `einops.rearrange(x, \"i j k -> k j i\")`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Note - the einops creators supposedly have plans to support shape rearrangement, e.g. with operations like `einops.einsum(x, y, \"i j, j k l -> i (k l)\")` (i.e. combining the features of rearrange and einsum), so we can all look forward to that day!*"
