On the other hand, the **universal approximation theorem** tells us that we can approximate any continuous function using a sufficiently large neural network, if we use nonlinear activation functions. It's worth emphasizing that the theory of the UAT and what networks look like in practice are very different - in particular, many versions of the UAT are based on a shallow but extremely wide neural network, on the other hand most of the power of modern neural networks comes from their ability to compose between layers: feeding the output of one layer into the input of another, and create increasingly expressive functions.

For the latter, we use `0.1307` and `0.3081` which are the empirical mean & std of the raw data (so after this transformation, the data will have mean 0 and variance 1).\n",

The first argument tells us where to save our data to (so that when we run this in the future we won't have to re-save it), and `transform=MNIST_TRANSFORM` tells us that we should apply our previously defined `transform` to each element in our dataset. We also use `Subset` which allows us to return a slice of the dataset rather than the whole thing (because our model won't need much data to train!).\n",

        "The `tqdm` function wraps around an iterable, and displays a progress bar as you iterate through it. The code below shows a minimal example:\n",

        "- If you define the progress bar `pbar = tqdm(...)` before your iteration, then you have the option of adding extra information to it using `pbar.set_description` or `pbar.set_postfix`\n",
        "- You can specify the total number of iterations with `tqdm(iterable, total=...)`; this is actually very important when the iterable is something like `enumerate(...)` which doesn't have a length attribute, since tqdm will usually try and infer the total from calling `len` on the iterable you pass it.\n",

For now, [this page](https://wandb.ai/wandb/common-ml-errors/reports/How-To-Use-GPU-with-PyTorch---VmlldzozMzAxMDk) should provide a basic overview of how to use your GPU. A few things to be aware of here:\n",

        "* Errors from having one tensor on cpu and another on cuda are very common. Some useful practices to avoid this:\n",
        "    * Throw in assert statements, to make sure tensors are on the same device\n",
        "    * Remember that when you initialise an array (e.g. with `t.zeros` or `t.arange`), it will be on CPU by default.\n",
        "    * Tensor methods like [`new_zeros`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_zeros.html) or [`new_full`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_full.html) are useful, because they'll create tensors which match the device and dtype of the base tensor.\n",

While training our model, we differentiate with respect to the average loss over all samples in the batch (so a smaller batch usually means the loss is more noisy). However, if you're working with large models, then often having a batch size too large will result in a memory error. This will be relevant for models later on in the course, but for now we're working with very small models so this isn't an issue.\n",

Don't worry about the details of this function, it's not the kind of thing you'll need to know by heart.\n",

We'll discuss optimizers in more detail tomorrow, but for now it's enough to understand that the optimizer calculates the amount to update parameters by (as a function of those parameters' gradients, and sometimes other inputs), and performs this update step. The first argument passed to our optimizer is the parameters of our model (because these are the values that will be updated via gradient descent), and you can also pass keyword arguments to the optimizer which change its behaviour (e.g. the learning rate).\n",

        "* You'll need a dataloader for the testset, just like we did for the trainset. It doesn't matter whether you shuffle the testset or not, because we're not updating our model parameters during validation (we usually set `shuffle=False` for testsets).\n",
        "    * You can set the same batch size as for your training set (we'll discuss more optimal choices for this later in the course).\n",
        "* During the validation step, you should be measuring **accuracy**, which is defined as **the fraction of correctly classified images**.\n",
        "    * Note that (unlike loss) accuracy should only be logged after you've gone through the whole validation set. This is because your model doesn't update between computing different accuracies, so it doesn't make sense to log all of them separately.\n",
        "    * Computing accuracy is meant to be a very short operation, so you shouldn't need a progress bar.\n",

        "A convolution is an operation which takes a kernel and slides it across the input, applying the kernel to each patch of the input. We can view it as a logical extension of the linear layer, except rather than having every output value being determined as a linear combination of every input value, we have a **prior of locality** - assuming that the input has some spatial structure, and each output value should only be determined by a small patch of the input. The kernel contains our learned weights, and we slide that kernel across our input, with each output value being computed by a sumproduct of the kernel values and the corresponding patch in the input. Note that we use all input channels when computing each output value, which means the sumproduct is over `kernel_length * in_channels` elements (or `kernel_width * kernel_height * in_channels` when, as is most often the case, we're using 2D kernels)."

        "To test your implementation, you can use the helper function `print_param_count` which prints out a stylized dataframe comparing your model's parameter count to the PyTorch implementation. Alternatively, you can use the following code to import your own `resnet34`, and inspect its architecture:\n",

        "```python\n",

        "Both will give you the shape & size of each of your model's parameters & buffers, and code is provided for both of these methods below.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note - in order to copy weights from the reference model to your implementation (which we'll do after this exercise), you'll need to have all the parameters defined in the same order as they are in the reference model - in other words, the rows from the two halves of the dataframe created via `print_param_count` should perfectly match up with each other. This can be a bit fiddly to get right, especially if the names of your parameters are different to the names in the PyTorch implementation. We recommend you look at the `__init__` methods of the solution if you're stuck (since it's the order that things are defined in for the various ResNet modules which determines the order of the rows in the dataframe).\n",
        "\n",
        "This 1-to-1 weight comparison won't always be possible during model replications, for example when we replicate GPT2-Small next week we'll be defining the attention weight matrices differently (in a way that's more condusive to interpretability research). In these cases, you'll need to resort to different debugging methods, like running the models on the same input and checking they give the same output. You can also break this down into smaller steps by running individual models, and by checking the shape before checking values. However in this case we don't need to resort to that, because our implementation is equivalent to the reference model's implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a more general point, tweaking your model until all the layers match up might be a difficult and frustrating exercise at times, however it's a pretty good example of the kind of low-level model implementation and debugging that is important for your growth as ML engineers! So don't be disheartened if you find it hard to get exactly right (although we certainly recommend looking at the solutions and moving on if you're stuck on this particular exercise for more than ~45 minutes)."

If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.\n",

Commonly, powers of 2 are chosen for computational efficiency, and deeper layers might have more channels to capture complex features.
